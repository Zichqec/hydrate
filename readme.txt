This is a simple ghost that reminds you to hydrate! You can customize how much time there is between reminders, set a reminder sound, and more.

There are also many shells you can download to change Hydrate's look. You can find them listed here:

If you'd like to make your own shells, or are interested in having your ghost receive stats from Hydrate, you can check in Hydrate's folder for documentation!
